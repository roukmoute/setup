: <<'man_set'
-e will exit as soon as any command fails
-x will output any executed command in the script
-u will refuse unbound variable (undefined)
-o pipefail will return the exit status code of any command that fails in a piped chain
ex: `ls | grep test | false`

long story short, you'd better add this `set -exuo pipefail` at the beginning of all your scripts!
it will make your bash scripts more robust
man_set

set -exuo pipefail

docker-compose exec php-fpm vendor/bin/phpspec $@
